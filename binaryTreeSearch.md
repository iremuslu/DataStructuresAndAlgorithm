  * In Binary Search Tree, I first determined the root element. I chose the root element as 7.
  * According to the Binary Search Tree, small elements are written to the left, and large elements are written to the right.
  * I took the root element and compared the elements in the array and placed them in the tree.
  * For example, when placing 5 after 7, I placed it on the left because it was smaller than 7, and when placing 8, I placed it on the right because it was larger than.
